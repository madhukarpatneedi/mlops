# CI/CD for TFX pipelines

In this lab you will walk through authoring of a Cloud Build CI/CD workflow that automatically builds and deploys a TFX pipeline. You will also integrate your workflow with GitHub by setting up a trigger that starts the workflow when a new tag is applied to the GitHub repo hosting the pipeline's code.


## Lab scenario

The lab instructions are in the `lab-03.ipynb`.
